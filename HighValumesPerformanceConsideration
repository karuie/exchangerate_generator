When considering the performance of the code with much higher volumes of data, such as 100,000 company records, several aspects should be taken into account. Here are some considerations to improve performance:

Optimize API requests: The code currently fetches exchange rates for each individual date within a given date range. With a large volume of data, this can result in a high number of API requests. Consider optimizing the code to fetch exchange rates in batches or use bulk requests to reduce the number of API calls. Some APIs provide batch or bulk request options for efficient data retrieval.

Efficient data processing: Analyzing and processing a large volume of data can be computationally expensive. Look for opportunities to optimize data processing operations, such as using vectorized operations or leveraging multi-threading or parallel processing techniques. Pandas provides many built-in functions and operations that are optimized for performance.

Memory management: Loading a large dataset into memory can lead to memory constraints. If memory becomes a concern, consider using techniques like chunking or streaming to process the data in smaller portions. You can use the pandas.DataFrame chunking functionality to process data in smaller subsets at a time.

Data structures: Review the data structures used in the code to ensure they are efficient for handling large volumes of data. For example, consider using more memory-efficient data structures like numpy arrays instead of lists if applicable.

Optimize code logic: Review the code logic for any inefficiencies or unnecessary computations that can be optimized or eliminated. Look for opportunities to minimize redundant calculations, unnecessary loops, or excessive memory usage.

Parallel processing: If the code logic allows for it, consider utilizing parallel processing techniques, such as multiprocessing or multithreading, to distribute the workload across multiple cores or threads. This can significantly improve the processing speed for large volumes of data.

Testing and profiling: Perform thorough testing and profiling of the code to identify any bottlenecks or performance issues. Use profiling tools to identify the sections of code that consume the most time or resources. This will help you pinpoint areas that require optimization.

Database optimization: If the data needs to be persisted and queried frequently, consider utilizing a database system optimized for handling large volumes of data. Relational databases like PostgreSQL or NoSQL databases like MongoDB can provide efficient data storage and retrieval mechanisms.
